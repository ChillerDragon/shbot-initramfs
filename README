Shbot is an IRC bot that runs shell code. It is a fork of evalbot
(http://www.vidarholen.net/contents/evalbot/).

To build, you'll need 

- Typical build tools: A C compiler, make, yacc, lex ...
- Header files of libraries needed to build bash, awk, mksh etc.
- Other standard and typical commands, like gzip, bzip2 and pax.

For Ubuntu/Debian

    sudo apt-get install build-essential pax
    sudo apt-get build-dep bash gawk mawk mksh

Should get most, if not all, build requirements down.

Run make
